An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. In short its an interface between computer hardware and user. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.

An operating system is software that manages computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system. A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.

Concerned with the assignment of resources among programs e.g. memory, processors, devices and informationoproutines. Similarly, the operating system has programs to carry out these tasks as with a traffic controller, scheduler, memory management module I/O program and file system.

History of Operating System
The operating system has been evolving through the years. The following table shows the history of OS.

Generation	Year	Electronic device used	Types of OS Devices
First	1945-55	Vacuum Tubes	Plug Boards
Second	1955-65	Transistors	Batch Systems
Third	1965-80	Integrated Circuits(IC)	Multiprogramming
Fourth	Since 1980	Large Scale Integration	PC
Characteristics of Operating Systems
Let us now discuss some of the important characteristic features of operating systems:

Device Management: The operating system keeps track of all the devices. So, it is also called the Input/Output controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.
File Management: It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource.
Job Accounting: It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users.
Error-detecting Aids: These contain methods that include the production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
Memory Management: It is responsible for managing the primary memory of a computer, including what part of it are in use by whom also check how much amount free or used and allocate process
Processor Management: It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor when it is no longer required or the job is done.
Control on System Performance: It records the delays between the request for a service and the system.
Security: It prevents unauthorized access to programs and data using passwords or some kind of protection technique.
Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used efficiently.
Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
Throughput: An OS should be constructed so that It can give maximum throughput (Number of tasks per unit time).

Functionalities of Operating System
Resource Management: When parallel accessing happens in the OS means when multiple users are accessing the system the OS works as Resource Manager, Its responsibility is to provide hardware to the user. It decreases the load in the system.
Process Management: It includes various tasks like scheduling and termination of the process. It is done with the help of CPU Scheduling algorithms .
Storage Management: The file system mechanism used for the management of the storage. NIFS , CIFS , CFS , NFS , etc. are some file systems. All the data is stored in various tracks of Hard disks that are all managed by the storage manager. It included Hard Disk .
Memory Management: Refers to the management of primary memory. The operating system has to keep track of how much memory has been used and by whom. It has to decide which process needs memory space and how much. OS also has to allocate and deallocate the memory space.
Security/Privacy Management: Privacy is also provided by the Operating system using passwords so that unauthorized applications canâ€™t access programs or data. For example, Windows uses Kerberos authentication to prevent unauthorized access to data.
